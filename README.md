# Dice-Roller-JS-Demo
I emulated a dice rolling program tutorial that functions with Javascript. I followed this website to make my own little changes:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/building-a-dice-game-using-javascript/

You can edit the player names, roll the dice and then wait a bit to see the result displayed on the page.

This is my first project on Github.
